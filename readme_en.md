## About Cantabile
Cantabile is the name of a research project to develop and prototype a multifunctional carbon dioxide measurement and notification device by using a microcontroller with general-purpose wireless communication functions and general-purpose communication standards such as Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi, instead of using expensive and unavailable specialized microcontrollers developed specifically for IoT and the specialized communication standards provided by them. This is the name of a research project to develop and prototype a multifunctional carbon dioxide measurement and notification device using microcontrollers with general-purpose wireless communication functions and general-purpose communication standards such as Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi, without using expensive and unavailable dedicated microcontrollers and the dedicated communication standards provided by them, and the wireless sensor network prototype developed in the research.
## Cantabile Goals
The goal of Cantabile is to develop a sensor network system that is relatively inexpensive, highly accurate, and has a high level of long-term operational stability, while maintaining a certain level of reliability, by using general-purpose microcontrollers with wireless communication capabilities and general-purpose communication standards, without using expensive and inaccessible specialized microcontrollers developed specifically for the IoT and the specialized communication standards provided by them. The goal is to develop a sensor network system that is relatively inexpensive, highly accurate, and has high long-term operational stability, while minimizing costs and maintaining a certain level of reliability. We believe that the knowledge and experience gained from the development of this system, as well as the problems and solutions that have arisen, can be applied to other wireless applications and networks.
